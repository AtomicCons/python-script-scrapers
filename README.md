# Project Python Script Scrapers
This project is to create a handful of scrapers that will scrape a URL for various filetypes and download them. 
When running the file, you will be prompted to specify a folder name, then a URL to scrape.
The folder will create a new folder in your Home directory. 

Python Script Scrapers will allow you to download entire PDF libraries with a few keystrokes.


### Future
Future versions will include:
  1. Arguments specified at launch
  2. Change filetype for scrape
  3. Allow scrape FTP
  4. Search beyond href elements
  5. Error handling


### Usage
download the script, launch with `Python3 scrapeHref.py`
